# OpenNOW Native Streamer

`OpenNOW Native Streamer` is the first-class native streaming backend for OpenNOW. It is designed as a separate process and native window that the Electron shell can launch behind a settings toggle.

This project uses:
- `C++20`
- `CMake`
- `SDL3` for windowing, audio device abstraction, and raw mouse/keyboard/controller input
- `libdatachannel` for WebRTC/DTLS/SRTP/DataChannel ownership
- `FFmpeg` for decode/audio pipeline scaffolding and hardware-acceleration probing

## Why this stack

The Electron renderer path remains the fastest way to keep the current app working, but it couples playback to Chromium. The native streamer gives OpenNOW a path toward:
- lower-overhead decode/render on Windows, macOS, Linux, and Linux ARM
- a dedicated native window instead of an embedded Chromium view
- direct SDL input capture for mouse, keyboard, and controller packets
- maintainable separation between CloudMatch/signaling orchestration and the native playback/runtime stack

## Electron/native split

Electron main process responsibilities stay in `opennow-stable/`:
- auth/session lifecycle
- CloudMatch create/poll/claim/stop
- signaling transport (`GfnSignalingClient`)
- settings persistence and UI
- launcher shell and fallback Chromium streamer

Native process responsibilities in this project:
- separate SDL window titled `OpenNOW Native Streamer`
- local IPC handshake with Electron main
- SDP/NVST helper ownership (`fixServerIp`, `extractPublicIp`, `preferCodec`, `mungeAnswerSdp`, `buildNvstSdp`, partial-reliability parsing)
- libdatachannel peer connection ownership for offer/answer, local ICE, remote ICE, and data channels
- FFmpeg decode ownership for received video/audio frames
- SDL render/audio output plus direct mouse/keyboard/controller capture

## IPC contract

Electron main and the native process communicate over a versioned length-prefixed JSON protocol on local loopback TCP.

Message framing:
- `u32` big-endian payload length
- UTF-8 JSON body

Protocol version:
- `1`

Core message types already reserved and wired:
- `hello`
- `session-config`
- `session-config-ack`
- `signaling-connected`
- `signaling-offer`
- `signaling-remote-ice`
- `answer`
- `local-ice`
- `disconnect`
- `state`
- `log`

This is intentionally socket-based instead of stdio so the transport can evolve without coupling lifecycle control to process pipes.

## Build

Dependencies are intentionally discovered through CMake instead of being hidden behind Electron.

Typical local build flow:

```bash
cmake -S opennow-native-streamer -B opennow-native-streamer/build
cmake --build opennow-native-streamer/build
```

If the required development libraries are missing, CMake will configure the project but print warnings for the unavailable subsystems.

## Current MVP status

This project now owns a minimum viable native stream path when `SDL3`, `FFmpeg`, and `libdatachannel` are present:
- Electron main launches a separate native process/window and proxies GFN signaling over versioned local IPC
- libdatachannel owns the native peer connection, answer generation, local ICE trickle, remote ICE ingestion, and negotiated data channels
- manual ICE candidate injection from `mediaConnectionInfo` is applied for GFN ICE-lite sessions
- FFmpeg decodes received video/audio frames and SDL3 renders video plus plays decoded PCM audio
- SDL3 mouse, keyboard, wheel, and controller input is encoded with the same packet framing semantics as the Chromium `inputProtocol.ts` path
- the Chromium/WebRTC renderer backend remains the default fallback when the setting is off

macOS presentation paths now prefer:
- `VideoToolbox + Metal/CVPixelBuffer direct presentation`: native macOS path, where VideoToolbox-decoded `CVPixelBuffer` surfaces are retained, exposed as `CVMetalTexture`, and presented through `CAMetalLayer`
- `VideoToolbox hardware decode + SDL YUV GPU upload`: fallback hardware path, where decoded frames are transferred to CPU-visible planes and uploaded through SDL YUV textures
- `software decode + SDL YUV/RGBA upload fallback`: fallback software path, where FFmpeg decodes to CPU-visible frames and the renderer uploads YUV or RGBA textures through SDL

The macOS direct path removes the previous mandatory `av_hwframe_transfer_data(...) -> CPU plane staging -> SDL_UpdateNVTexture/SDL_UpdateYUVTexture(...)` hot path for VideoToolbox-backed frames. Remaining copies in the preferred path are limited to the native surface/Metal presentation plumbing needed to bind `CVPixelBuffer` planes as Metal textures for final draw. If native-surface presentation fails at runtime, the fallback to the SDL upload path is sticky and immediately reflected in diagnostics and overlay path reporting.

Raspberry Pi 4 decoder selection now prefers:
- `h264_v4l2m2m` for H.264 when the Pi 4 V4L2 M2M decoder is available
- `hevc_v4l2m2m` for H.265/HEVC when the Pi 4 V4L2 M2M decoder is available
- software decode fallback when the Pi hardware path is unavailable or fails to initialize

On Raspberry Pi 4, AV1 is not advertised as a hardware-decoded path. The native streamer logs that limitation and falls back to software AV1 decode when AV1 is negotiated. Diagnostics and the native overlay report the actual FFmpeg decoder/backend name, whether the path is hardware or software, and the active render/upload path.

## Raspberry Pi 4 / Linux ARM64

The native streamer now includes an explicit Linux ARM64 decoder-selection ladder aimed at Raspberry Pi 4:

- `H264` → prefer FFmpeg `h264_v4l2m2m`
- `H265/HEVC` → prefer FFmpeg `hevc_v4l2m2m` when the Pi runtime exposes it cleanly
- `AV1` → no fake Pi 4 hardware path; log the limitation and fall back to software decode
- if Pi-specific hardware decode cannot initialize, fall back to the next supported path and finally to software decode

Runtime diagnostics, logs, and the native overlay report:
- negotiated codec
- actual FFmpeg decoder/backend name in use
- `hardware` vs `software`
- active render/upload path

Typical Pi 4 paths look like:
- `video path: Raspberry Pi 4 V4L2 M2M H264 hardware decode + SDL YUV/RGBA upload`
- `video path: Raspberry Pi 4 V4L2 M2M HEVC hardware decode + SDL YUV/RGBA upload`
- `video path: software AV1 decode + SDL YUV/RGBA upload fallback`

The current Pi/Linux ARM64 implementation does **not** claim a zero-copy renderer. The Pi-optimized work in this PR is decoder selection/fallback and honest diagnostics; presentation still uses the existing SDL upload path.

### Local build on Raspberry Pi 4 / Linux ARM64

Install practical host/build dependencies first:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y \
  build-essential \
  cmake \
  ninja-build \
  pkg-config \
  nasm \
  libsdl3-dev \
  libwayland-dev \
  wayland-protocols \
  libx11-dev \
  libxext-dev \
  libxrandr-dev \
  libxcursor-dev \
  libxi-dev \
  libxfixes-dev \
  libxrender-dev \
  libxss-dev \
  libxkbcommon-dev \
  libdrm-dev \
  libgbm-dev \
  libegl1-mesa-dev \
  libavcodec-dev \
  libavformat-dev \
  libavutil-dev \
  libswresample-dev \
  libswscale-dev
```

`libdatachannel` is expected via `vcpkg` in CI and is the most reliable local path too:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg.git ~/vcpkg
~/vcpkg/bootstrap-vcpkg.sh -disableMetrics
```

Then configure/build the native streamer:

```bash
cmake \
  -S opennow-native-streamer \
  -B opennow-native-streamer/build \
  -G Ninja \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
  -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE="$HOME/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake" \
  -DVCPKG_TARGET_TRIPLET=arm64-linux

cmake --build opennow-native-streamer/build --config Release
```

Those desktop dependencies matter on Raspberry Pi OS because SDL3 only exposes `wayland`, `x11`, or `kmsdrm` video drivers if it was built with the corresponding Wayland/X11/DRM development packages available.

Resulting binary:

```bash
./opennow-native-streamer/build/opennow-native-streamer
```

### Manual native binary smoke run on Pi / Linux ARM64

The binary is normally launched by Electron main over loopback IPC. For a manual smoke check you can start it directly:

```bash
./opennow-native-streamer/build/opennow-native-streamer \
  --ipc-host=127.0.0.1 \
  --ipc-port=9000 \
  --session-id=pi-smoke-test
```

That only verifies process startup and window/runtime initialization. A real stream still requires the Electron app to create the session, own signaling, and connect to the native helper.

On Raspberry Pi desktop sessions, the native app now prefers SDL backends in this order:

1. `wayland` when `WAYLAND_DISPLAY` is set
2. `x11` when `DISPLAY` is set
3. `kmsdrm`

`offscreen` should only be used for diagnostics, not normal streaming.

At startup, the native binary prints:
- available SDL video drivers compiled into the build
- available SDL audio drivers
- preferred Linux driver order selected by the app
- the SDL video/audio driver actually chosen at runtime

You can verify this directly:

```bash
./opennow-native-streamer/build/opennow-native-streamer \
  --ipc-host=127.0.0.1 \
  --ipc-port=9000 \
  --session-id=pi-smoke-test 2>&1 | tee native-startup.log
```

Look for lines like:

```text
[OpenNOW Native Streamer] SDL video drivers available: wayland,x11,kmsdrm
[OpenNOW Native Streamer] SDL selected video driver: wayland
[OpenNOW Native Streamer] SDL selected audio driver: pipewire
```

If audio device initialization fails, the app now reports the active SDL audio backend in the error so Pi audio-stack issues are diagnosable from the terminal and from Electron-captured stderr.

For end-to-end testing with the Electron shell, point OpenNOW at the built binary:

```bash
export OPENNOW_NATIVE_STREAMER_BIN="$PWD/opennow-native-streamer/build/opennow-native-streamer"
```

Then launch the Electron app, enable the `OpenNOW Native Streamer` beta toggle in settings, and start a session.

### GitHub Actions Linux ARM64 artifact

The native streamer CI workflow now builds a Linux ARM64 artifact on a GitHub-hosted ARM runner:

- workflow artifact name: `opennow-native-streamer-linux-arm64`
- contained binary: `opennow-native-streamer`

Practical usage on a Pi 4:

1. Download the `linux-arm64` artifact from the PR or workflow run.
2. Extract it onto the Pi, for example into `~/OpenNOW-native/`.
3. Ensure runtime libraries are installed (`SDL3`, FFmpeg shared libraries, standard C++ runtime).
4. Point OpenNOW at the extracted binary:

```bash
export OPENNOW_NATIVE_STREAMER_BIN="$HOME/OpenNOW-native/opennow-native-streamer"
```

5. Launch OpenNOW and enable the native streamer toggle.

Still intentionally partial in this task:
- Raspberry Pi 4/Linux ARM64 prefers explicit FFmpeg backend ladders (`h264_v4l2m2m`, `hevc_v4l2m2m` when available) but still falls back to software when the runtime cannot sustain the hardware path
- microphone parity is not migrated yet
- recording/screenshot/overlay parity is not migrated yet
- H265/AV1 platform capability handling is structured but will need more real-device validation

If required native dependencies are unavailable, the Electron-side toggle surfaces a clear launch failure without affecting future Chromium fallback launches.
